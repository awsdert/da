Open source Driver API

Many manufacturers don't want to spend resources on supporting the
various linux distros simply because it is infeasible, this library's
goal is to wrap the various APIs and provide a single API for such
manufacturers to work with so that all distros can be supported.

This goal will only be achieved if they all pull together to submit
patches on the parts they need and I will subsequently merge them
together after ensuring they gel with the whatever the current API
is at, once merged they can then update the version of the API they
need to compile their driver and update their code to use the new
functionality.

Until that starts happening this will be just a hobby project that I
will be filling in as and when I feel like it, with any luck the
various distro developers will realise the importance of such an API
and begin helping out and the knock on affect will be the final nail
in M$'s self made casket as gaming companies begin to take advantage
of this API to do their 3D acceleration stuff (e.g Sony's FFXV).
